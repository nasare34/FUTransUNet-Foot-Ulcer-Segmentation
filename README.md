# FUTransUNet ‚Äì Foot Ulcer Segmentation

**Self-Attention for Clinical Precision**  
*A Hybrid Transformer-U-Net with Grad-CAM for High-Fidelity Foot Ulcer Segmentation*

---

## üìÑ Paper
This repository contains the implementation of **FUTransUNet**, a novel hybrid deep learning architecture that integrates the **global attention mechanism of Vision Transformers (ViTs)** into the **U-Net** framework for automated segmentation of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) from clinical photographs.  

Our approach was evaluated on the **Foot Ulcer Segmentation Challenge (FUSeg)** dataset and demonstrated **high segmentation accuracy with enhanced interpretability** via Grad-CAM visualizations.

## üß† Model Overview

- **Hybrid Architecture**: Combines **Vision Transformers** for capturing global context with **U-Net** for fine-grained localization.  
- **Transformer Bottleneck**: A Transformer block is placed at the U-Net bottleneck for enriched feature representation.  
- **Model Interpretability**: Uses **Grad-CAM** to visualize regions of attention during predictions.  

**Key Strengths:**
- High-fidelity segmentation  
- Clinically relevant attention maps  
- Robust performance on a challenging medical imaging dataset

## üß™ Dataset

- **Source**: Foot Ulcer Segmentation Challenge (FUSeg) dataset  
- **Size**: 1,200+ de-identified clinical images with binary masks  
- **Mask Encoding**:  
  - `255` = ulcer  
  - `0` = non-ulcer
